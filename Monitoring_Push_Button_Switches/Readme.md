# Monitoring Push Button Switches – GPIO

## Overview

This module contains practice problems for learning switch input handling and LED output control using bare-metal GPIO programming on the ATmega2560 microcontroller (Arduino Mega). All programs are written in C using direct register manipulation (DDRx, PORTx, PINx) without Arduino library functions.

## What I Learned

- Reading digital input from push button switches
- Switch debouncing techniques
- Conditional LED control based on switch states
- Custom pattern generation triggered by switch inputs
- Multi-switch combination logic

## Problem Sets

- **[Set 8](./Set_8/)** - Basic switch-controlled LED patterns
- **[Set 9](./Set_9/)** - Advanced switch-triggered custom LED sequences

## Tools Used

- **Microcontroller**: ATmega2560 (Arduino Mega)
- **Language**: C (bare-metal)
- **Simulation**: Wokwi
- **Hardware**: Push button switches and LEDs

## Structure

Each set contains:
- Source files (`.c`)
- README with problem descriptions and Wokwi simulation links
