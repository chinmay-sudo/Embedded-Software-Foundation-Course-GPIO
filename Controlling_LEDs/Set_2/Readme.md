# Set 2 

## Overview

This directory contains ten small problems demonstrating register-level GPIO LED control on the ATmega2560 microcontroller (Arduino Mega). All programs are written in C and use direct register access only, without Arduino helper functions. Each problem is accompanied by a Wokwi simulation link corresponding to the given problem.
