# Controlling LEDs – GPIO

## Overview

This module contains practice problems for learning bare-metal GPIO programming on the ATmega2560 microcontroller (Arduino Mega). All programs are written in C using direct register manipulation (DDRx and PORTx) without Arduino library functions.

## What I Learned

- Direct register-level GPIO configuration and control
- Bitwise operations for LED manipulation
- Creating various LED patterns and sequences
- Implementing delays and timing at the hardware level

## Problem Sets

- **[Set 1](./Set_1/)** - Basic LED control on different ports
- **[Set 2](./Set_2/)** - Sequential patterns, one-by-one LED control
- **[Set 3](./Set_3/)** - Advanced sequential patterns with custom ordering
- **[Set 4](./Set_4/)** - Dual-row LED control across multiple ports

## Tools Used

- **Microcontroller**: ATmega2560 (Arduino Mega)
- **Language**: C (bare-metal)
- **Simulation**: Wokwi

## Structure

Each set contains:
- Source files (`.c`)
- README with problem descriptions and Wokwi simulation links
