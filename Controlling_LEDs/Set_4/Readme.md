# Set 4

## Overview

This directory contains ten problems demonstrating dual-row LED control on the ATmega2560 microcontroller (Arduino Mega). All programs use direct register access without Arduino helper functions. Each problem includes a Wokwi simulation link.

## Problems

All problems use two rows of Eight LEDs each connected to port A bit 0 to bit 7 and port B bit 0 to bit 7.
