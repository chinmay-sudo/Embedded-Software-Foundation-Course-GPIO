# Set 11

## Overview

This directory contains ten problems demonstrating 8x8 dot matrix LED control on the ATmega2560 microcontroller (Arduino Mega). All programs use direct register access without Arduino helper functions. Each problem includes a Wokwi simulation link.

## Files

- Source files: `ETALVIS_DotMatrix_Set_11_Problem_*.c`
